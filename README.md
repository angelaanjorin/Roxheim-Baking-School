# User Experience - UX

## User Stories

* As a front end website creator, I want to:

1. Build a website that is attractive visually to the user, to make them explore the website and potentially become clients of the business.
2. Build a user friendly website to make it easy for the user to navigate.

* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. Understand the main purpose of the website.
2. Be able to easily navigate the site to get all relevant information that i need.
3. Be able to easily contact the business and signup for bakery classes.

## Design

### Website Structure

The Roxheim Bakery School website is a four page site: Home Page, Signup Page, Thank you Page and Gallery Page. The Home Page has five sections, (1) Header, (2) Xmas, (3) Intro, (4) Classes, (5) Footer with Social Networks links. The Home Page is linked to all the other pages through the Navigation Menu at the top right part of the header. The Home Page has also a link within the Class section to the Signup Page. The Signup Page and Gallery Page have also the same Navigation Menu and a link to the Home Page through the Logo.

### Color Scheme

![Home Page](./assets/images/READMEimages/Create-a-Palette-Coolors1.png)
There are four main colors used: (1) White (#ffffff), (2) brown-derby (#5b4435) (3)sinopi (#D43F17ff) (4) drab-dark-brown (#463B24ff). The last color is used as a default font color. The background is white and sinopi (#D43F17ff) is used as a highlighter on very large screen devices for the hover effect on the signup page.

### Typography

* The Oswald, sans-serif is used for the Headings.
* The default font set by the style.sheet is Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif used for the test.

### Imagery

* 3 background images, one as the first section of the Home Page, the other used in the class section of the Home Page and the last used on the Signup Page.
* 1 image for the intro section of the Home Page.
* 1 image for the thank you Page.
* 12 images for the Gallery Page.
* Note: all images were converted to the webp files.

### Interactive Links

* In the footer, users can access the school´s social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram). Once the icons for the social media links are clicked, the user is directed to a new tab with the respective sites. 
* There is an internal link in the class section of the Home Page, directing the user to the Signup Page to sign up for the classes.

## Future Features

### Customer Review Section

* If there is a Review Section with parents telling how thier children enjoyed the baking classes, this would help the user to gain confidence to signup for a class.

### Shop Section

* A shop can be used on many levels to generate extra money for the school, selling all kinds of things from recipies, baking utensils, baking aprons and gloves and hats for the children, recipe books etc. Selling digital courses for children who can´t come to the school either because they live too far or the days and times of the provides classes are just not convenient for the user. Older children and even adults can also benefit from the digital courses. 

### About me Section

* More infromation about the teacher of the Roxheim Bakery School would help the users to know more about the person behind the school building more trust.
