# User Experience - UX

## User Stories

#### New User:  
* As a new user, I am looking to find information regarding baking classes for children.

## Development Planes:
To create a website that is comprehensive and informative for a user, as a developer you need to look at all aspects of the website and how someone who visits your website will use it. You have to consider all the user stories that have been outlined in the above sections.  

## Strategy
The strategy principal looks at user needs, as well product/service objectives. This websites target audience was broken down into three categories:

### Roles: 
* New User
* Existing User  

### Demographic:
* Parents of young children
* Grandparents of young children
* Resident in Roxheim, Germany 

### Psychographic:

#### Lifestyle:

#### Values:
* Teaching children life skills at a young age  

#### The website needs to allow users to:  
* View times of classes for their child's age group

#### The website needs to allow the teacher at the school to:  
* Receive signups from parents/grandparents/guardians   
* Get contacted also through it´s social networks from site visitors through the various social network icons on the website  

## Scope:  

With the structure in place, it was then time to move onto the scope plane. This was all about developing website requirements based on the goals set out in the strategy plane. These requirements are broken down into two categories.

### Content Requirements:
1. The user will be looking for:
      * Information on class times 
      * Information on the bakery school
      * Techniques on how to make something they may not have done before

### Functionality Requirements:
1. The user will be able to:
      * Navigate through the site to find the information they need
      * Signup to the classes offered on the site.
      * Get more information through the icon links to the social networks of the school.

## Design

### Website Structure
The information above was then used to create a structure for the website. The Skeleton of the website was created on paper. 
The Roxheim Bakery School website is a four page site: Home Page, Signup Page, Thank you Page and Gallery Page. The Home Page has five sections, (1) Header, (2) Xmas, (3) Intro, (4) Classes, (5) Footer with Social Networks links. The Home Page is linked to all the other pages through the Navigation Menu at the top right part of the header. The Home Page has also a link within the Class section to the Signup Page. The Signup Page and Gallery Page have also the same Navigation Menu and a link to the Home Page through the Logo.

### Color Scheme

![Home Page](./assets/images/READMEimages/Create-a-Palette-Coolors1.png)
* The color scheme of the website was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) from the main picture on the Home Page. 
* There are four main colors used: (1) White (#ffffff), (2) brown-derby (#5b4435) (3)sinopi (#D43F17ff) (4) drab-dark-brown (#463B24ff). The last color is used as a default font color. The background is white and sinopi (#D43F17ff) is used as a highlighter on very large screen devices for the hover effect on the signup page.

### Typography

* The Oswald, sans-serif is used for the Headings.
* The default font set by the style.sheet is Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif used for the test.

### Imagery

* 3 background images, one as the first section of the Home Page, the other used in the class section of the Home Page and the last used on the Signup Page.
* 1 image for the intro section of the Home Page.
* 1 image for the thank you Page.
* 12 images for the Gallery Page.
* Note: all images were converted to the webp files.

### Interactive Links

* In the footer, users can access the school´s social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram). Once the icons for the social media links are clicked, the user is directed to a new tab with the respective sites. 
* There is an internal link in the class section of the Home Page, directing the user to the Signup Page to sign up for the classes.

[Live Gallery Page](https://angelaanjorin.github.io/Roxheim-Baking-School/gallery.html)

## Future Features

### Customer Review Section

* If there is a Review Section with parents telling how thier children enjoyed the baking classes, this would help the user to gain confidence to signup for a class.

### Shop Section

* A shop can be used on many levels to generate extra money for the school, selling all kinds of things from recipies, baking utensils, baking aprons and gloves and hats for the children, recipe books etc. Selling digital courses for children who can´t come to the school either because they live too far or the days and times of the provides classes are just not convenient for the user. Older children and even adults can also benefit from the digital courses. 

### About me Section

* More infromation about the teacher of the Roxheim Bakery School would help the users to know more about the person behind the school building more trust.
