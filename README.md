## Design

The Roxheim Bakery School website is a four page site: Home Page, Signup Page, Thank you Page and Gallery Page. The Home Page has five sections, (1) Header, (2) Xmas, (3) Intro, (4) Classes, (5) Footer with Social Networks links. The Home Page is linked to all the other pages through the Navigation Menu at the top right part of the header. The Home Page has also a link within the Class section to the Signup Page. The Signup Page and Gallery Page have also the same Navigation Menu and a link to the Home Page through the Logo.

### Color Scheme

The background is white and sinopi (#D43F17ff) is used as a highlighter on very large screen devices for the hover effect on the signup page.

### Interactive Links
